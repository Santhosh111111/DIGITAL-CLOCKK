Objective:
The aim of this project is to create a digital clock using Python. The digital clock will display the current time and update every second to ensure accurate timekeeping.

Key Features:

    Real-time Display: The clock will continuously display the current time, updating every second.
    User Interface: The project will utilize a graphical user interface (GUI) to present the time in a clear and visually appealing format.
    Customization: Users can choose different time formats (12-hour or 24-hour) and customize the appearance of the clock (font, color, size).

Tools and Libraries:

    Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
    Tkinter: A standard GUI library in Python, which will be used to create the clock's interface.
    Time Module: Utilized to fetch the current system time and handle the timing mechanism for updating the display.
